# ðŸ§© Coding Practice Archive

This folder contains a collection of algorithm and problem-solving exercises Iâ€™ve worked on from various online competitive programming platforms.

Each subfolder represents a different platformâ€”like CSES, LeetCode, or Codeforcesâ€”and includes the problems Iâ€™ve tackled along with my solutions in Python and C++. Itâ€™s my way of organizing and tracking my learning progress in algorithm design, data structures, and problem-solving techniques.

Feel free to explore the folders to see how I approached different types of challenges and how my code has evolved over time. Whether you're here to review specific problems, compare approaches in two languages, or just browse, I hope you find something helpful or interesting along the way.
