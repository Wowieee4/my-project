# 🏢 Companies & Projects

This folder contains a collection of all the companies I’ve worked with and the projects I contributed to during my time there.

Each subfolder represents a different company and includes relevant projects, code samples, and work I’ve done as part of those roles. It’s a way to organize and showcase my professional experience and achievements.

Feel free to explore to get a better sense of the kinds of challenges I’ve tackled and the skills I’ve developed along the way.
