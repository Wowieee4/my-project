# ðŸ‘‹ Welcome to My Project Hub

Hi there! I'm Evan â€” and this is my personal space where I build, experiment, and grow as a developer.

---

This repository is a **living collection** of my projects â€” from tiny automation scripts and learning experiments to full-fledged applications.  
Some are practical, some are just for fun, but all of them represent my journey as a **lifelong learner and builder**.

Whether you're here to explore, give feedback, or collaborate â€” you're more than welcome.
