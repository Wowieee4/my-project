# 🤖 Simple Discord Bot (Demo)

This is a **simple Discord bot written in Python** built just to **showcase basic bot logic and message handling** using `discord.py`. The bot is already running and working successfully in my own server.

---

## ✨ What It Does

- Responds to certain text messages like "halo" or "lempar dadu dong"
- Sends private messages when the command starts with `?`
- Uses environment variables (`.env`) to keep the bot token safe
- Prints user message info to the console for testing and debugging

---

## ⚠️ Notes

This is **not meant to be a full-featured bot**, just a demonstration of:
- Basic message handling in Discord
- How a bot can reply publicly or privately
- Simple Python structure for beginner bot development

The code is intentionally kept short and clear, as it's part of a **personal project presentation** — not a public tool or library.

---

## ✅ Status

✔️ The bot is up and running on my server  
✔️ Code is clean, minimal, and working as intended  
✔️ Only built for demo purposes — not for production use
