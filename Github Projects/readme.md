# 🚀 My Coding Projects

This repository highlights two key aspects of my coding journey:

---

### 🧩 Learning Projects  
This is where I explore, experiment, and grow. From beginner challenges to more advanced concepts, these projects are about **trying new ideas**, **learning from mistakes**, and **improving one step at a time**.  
They’re not perfect — and that’s exactly the point.

---

### 🌟 Polished Projects  
These are the projects I’ve taken the time to refine and finish with care. They reflect what I’ve learned so far and showcase the progress I’m making as a developer.

Every project — whether a rough draft or something polished — moves me forward on my journey.  
Thanks for stopping by and following along! 👨‍💻✨
