ðŸš€ My Coding Projects
This repo showcases two key parts of my coding journey:

ðŸ§© Learning Projects
Hereâ€™s where I experiment and grow. From beginner to advanced challenges, these projects are all about trying new things, making mistakes, and getting better step by step. Theyâ€™re not perfect â€” but thatâ€™s the point!

ðŸŒŸ Polished Projects
These are the projects Iâ€™ve refined and feel proud to share. They highlight what Iâ€™ve learned and show the progress Iâ€™m making as a developer.
