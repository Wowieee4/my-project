ðŸ“‚ My Coding Journey
This folder is where I learn by doing â€” one project at a time. Iâ€™ve split everything into beginner, intermediate, and advanced so I can look back and see how far Iâ€™ve come (and how far I still want to go).

None of these projects are perfect â€” and thatâ€™s the point. Theyâ€™re experiments. Some are messy, some donâ€™t work the way I expected, but every single one taught me something. This is my space to try things, make mistakes, and get better with every line of code.
