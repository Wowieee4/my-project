# ðŸ§  My Coding Journey

This folder is where I learn by building. Iâ€™ve split it into **Beginner**, **Intermediate**, and **Advanced** sections to track my progress step by step.

These projects arenâ€™t perfect, theyâ€™re meant for learning. Some are rough, some are unfinished, but each one helped me understand something new. Itâ€™s all part of the process.

> Every mistake teaches me more. Every project teaches me something new.
